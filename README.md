# Diabetes Risk Model for Native Women
Due to This diabetes risk calculator tool was created to help Native American women self-diagnose their health. To do this we used the GridSearchCV library to hypertune Random Forest and neural network classification models. Using a dataset of the health statistics from Pima Native Indian women, our model was trained to output an individuals diabetic risk percentage.
